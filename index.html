       <br>
       <p class="maintext">In 2020, the Brazilian influencer Mário Júnior grew popular beyond TikTok as he was turned into a national meme. One of the motivators was the fact that he was producing content in a format that is typical to the platform: POV or point of view. This audiovisual format generally appears in the tab “For You” on TikTok, which is a section that offers similar content to what the user has engaged previously, <br>but not necessarily published by profiles they already follow.</P>
       <br>
       <p class="maintext">For that reason, the POV format has become a new engagement strategy in a social network that promotes the remix of videos, sounds and memes. In order to stand out in an ocean of similar content (that is, a same meme or viral trend being reproduced, only performed by different people), the POV format has generated engagement precisely because it is supposedly more “humane”.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="maintext">Using soundtracks that, oftentimes, feature lyrics that communicate the message the creator wants to share, POV videos can also be very specific: they may portray embarrassing and trivial moments for teenagers or even the simulation of a relationship, such as in the <br>case of Mário Júnior.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="maintext">Ultimately, as suggested in this <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bj9qq5/this-meme-explains-why-tiktok-isnt-like-any-other-social-media""#" style="color:#bfa9f7;">article</a>, POV videos promote empathy between users and, this way, they can address situations or topics that are sensitive to this audience mostly composed of people younger than 34. By the way, this is also the demographic for those who watch the videos and streamings of lo-fi hip hop playlists on YouTube.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="maintext">YouTube channels such as Chillhop Music, ChilledCow, and Mellowbeat Seeker are some examples of creators that are publishing playlists or livestreaming this music genre. Curated by humans, the streamed songs are characterized by its low fidelity sounds (lo-fi), samples extracted from popular sources, and titles that oftentimes <br>are already a disclaimer of the intention of these radios — examples include the songs “Things will be better by morning” by Jonas Langer or “I have love for everyone besides myself” by barnesblvd.</p>

       <br>
       <p class="maintext">Hence, based on the conclusions arrived by Winston and Saywood, the only choice for millennials and the following generations is to adopt this metamodern stand of “guilty pleasure”: it is about laughing and empathizing with everyday challenges at the same time you give a like to that post, leave a comment, follow the profile or even donate some money that cements the structures of late and algorithmic capitalism.</p>
       <p class="maintext">This sounds much like a Brazilian expression that says “bite and blow”, which is about a bad behavior that is followed by praise, so it can mitigate the effects of the first act. In this context, lo-fi hip hop and POV playlists are contradictorily born in the mechanisms of late (and algorithmic) capitalism at the same time they attempt to comfort listeners affected by these same actors. Once again, Mark Fisher can be mentioned here for when he argues in “Capitalist Realism” that even oppositional attitudes towards capitalism are co-opted by the system and turned into a product — to the point that even the theorist himself has already become a meme.</p>
       <p class="maintext">Therefore, finding aesthetic trends like “Dark Academia” or simply “Academia” popping out on social media platforms like Tumblr, Pinterest and TikTok is just a corroboration to the analysis made by Winston and Saywood — also because, besides this romanticization of academic environments, of the acts of reading and studying, some users may share rants about their efforts to pass the exams or finish a series of homework, for instance. For this reason, the researchers believe that lo-fi hip hop (and I would extend this to POV playlists too), in its own contradiction, expresses precisely our contemporary spirit:</p>
       <p class="quote">“Lofi hip hop’s student participants are among the first generation too young to remember a time before what Jonathan Crary refers to as “the paradoxes of the expanding, non-stop life-world of twenty-first-century capitalism…inseparable from shifting configurations of sleep and waking, illumination and darkness, justice and terror, and…exposure, unprotectedness, and vulnerability”. If twenty-first-century normality is characterized by “systemic impossibility”, then, perhaps, engaging with the impossible through popular culture is simply a way to make sense of everyday life.”</p>
       <p class="maintext">This ubiquity of music, of 24/7 livestreams, can thus represent precisely the nonlinearity of contemporary life, something that Winston and Saywood claim to be a characteristic of late capitalism. Jonathan Crary uses the term “24/7 capitalism”, since it is “not simply a continuous or sequential capture of attention, but a dense layering of time, in which multiple operations or attractions can be attended to in near-simultaneity, regardless of where one is or whatever else one might be doing.” When living like this, burnout is just around the corner.</p>
       <p class="maintext">While fomenting what the researchers call “ubiquitous listening”, these streamings reinforce a “passive, inattentive form of listening which…is a result of the omnipresence of music in contemporary life, and which is characterized by people ‘living in industrialized settings…listen(ing) ‘alongside’ or simultaneous with other activities’.”</p>
